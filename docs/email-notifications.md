# Email Notifications Spec
**Version**: 2026.06.01.V2  
**Objective**: Define all production email notifications, their triggers, recipients, and operational expectations.

## 1. Scope
This document covers email notifications implemented in:
- `functions/emailService.js`
- `functions/index.js`

It is the source of truth for:
- Trigger conditions
- Recipients
- Core payload/content
- Deep links
- Failure handling expectations

## 2. Notification Matrix
| Notification | Trigger | Recipient | Function | Deep Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Welcome | Firebase Auth user created | New user | `sendWelcomeEmail` | `/learning-path.html?path=tw-common`, `/learning-path.html?path=tw-car-starter`, `/dashboard.html` |
| Payment success | `paymentNotify` success | Student | `sendPaymentSuccessEmail` | `/dashboard.html?tab=overview` |
| Trial expiring | Scheduled check | Student | `sendTrialExpiringEmail` | `/dashboard.html` |
| Course expiring | Scheduled check | Student | `sendCourseExpiringEmail` | `/dashboard.html` |
| Tutor authorization granted | `authorizeTutorForCourse(add)` | Tutor | `sendTutorAuthorizationEmail` | `/dashboard.html?unitId=...&tab=assignments` |
| Assignment submitted | `submitAssignment` with `status=submitted` | Assigned tutor | `sendAssignmentNotification` | `/dashboard.html?...&tab=assignments` |
| Student linked to tutor | `upsertStudentUnitAssignment` flow | Student | `sendStudentLinkedToTutorEmail` | `/dashboard.html?unitId=...&tab=assignments` |
| Tutor linked to student | `upsertStudentUnitAssignment` flow | Tutor | `sendTutorLinkedToStudentEmail` | `/dashboard.html?unitId=...&tab=assignments` |
| New tutor application | `applyForTutorRole` / `submitTutorRecommendationInviteLink` | Admin | `sendAdminNewApplicationEmail` | `/dashboard.html?unitId=...&tab=tutors`（Tutor Management） |
| Tutor application result | `decideTutorApplication` | Applicant | `sendApplicationResultEmail` | `/dashboard.html?unitId=...&tab=assignments` |
| Pending tutor-binding reminder | Daily schedule | Student | `sendStudentPendingTutorAssignmentReminder` | `/dashboard.html?tab=assignments` |
| Admin pending shipment reminder | Daily schedule | Admin / ops | `sendAdminShipmentReminder` | `/dashboard.html?tab=shipments` |
| Autograde result (student) | `ingestGithubAutograde` success | Student | `sendAutogradeResultToStudent` | `/dashboard.html?unitId=...&tab=assignments` |
| Autograde result (tutor) | `ingestGithubAutograde` success | Assigned tutor | `sendAutogradeResultToTutor` | `/dashboard.html?unitId=...&tab=assignments` |
| Order shipped | Distributor / partner marks order as shipped | Student | `sendOrderShippedEmail` | `/dashboard.html?tab=overview` |
| Tutor recommendation candidate | `recommendTutorForUnit` success | Candidate student | `sendTutorRecommendationCandidateEmail` | `/dashboard.html?unitId=...&tab=assignments&action=submitTutorInvite&applicationId=...` |
| Autograde failure alert | `ingestGithubAutograde` validation/runtime failure | Admin | `sendAutogradeFailureAlertEmail` | `/dashboard.html?tab=tutors`（Tutor Management） |
| Order activation failure alert | `paymentNotify` success but activation validation fails | Admin | `sendAutogradeFailureAlertEmail` | `/dashboard.html?tab=overview` |

## 2.1 Implementation Notes
The notification matrix above is the contract. The current implementation in `functions/emailService.js` uses shared template helpers to keep those messages consistent:
- `renderCtaButton`
- `renderActionButton`
- `renderCalloutPanel`
- `renderReminderBlock`
- `renderInfoCard`
- `buildAutogradeInfoRows`
- `buildCourseUnitInfoRows`
- `buildApplicationInfoRows`
- `buildSingleInfoRow`

These helpers are implementation details only. They do not change the delivery matrix, recipients, or deep-link expectations listed in section 2.

## 3. Key Operational Rules
1. Links in email must be generated via `APP_BASE_URL` and include tab/unit context whenever possible.
2. Assignment emails must prefer `unitId + tab=assignments` deep links to reduce navigation friction.
3. Autograde writeback failures must notify admin with payload preview to speed incident triage.
4. Notification send failures should not block business transaction completion (current behavior: best-effort send with error logging).
5. Pending tutor-binding reminder only targets students with paid course units that still have no tutor assignment; hardware items and free courses are excluded.
6. Shipment reminders now refer to pending fulfillment tasks assigned to distributors / partners, not direct platform-to-customer shipping.
7. Payment success must run order activation validation immediately. If a paid digital item cannot map to a canonical course/unit or cannot pass the shared authorization logic, the order stores `activationValidationStatus=failed` and sends an admin alert.

## 4. Deprecated / Legacy Notes
1. `sendGradingNotification` currently exists as a legacy template from manual grading flow.
2. Manual grading endpoint `gradeAssignment` is disabled; autograde is the active scoring path.
3. `submitAssignment(status=submitted)` email path still exists as a legacy/manual fallback, but the default student flow is now `前往作業 -> Promotion code 綁定 -> 直接開啟作業 Repo`.

## 5. Environment Variables
- `MAIL_USER`
- `MAIL_PASS`
- `APP_BASE_URL`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`

## 6. Runbook (Incident Quick Checks)
1. If no emails are sent:
   - Verify `MAIL_USER` and `MAIL_PASS`.
   - Check Cloud Functions logs for transporter/auth errors.
2. If autograde alert spam appears:
   - Check GitHub payload mapping (`userId+unitId`).
   - Verify `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` signature setup.
3. If admin links open wrong tab:
   - Verify `APP_BASE_URL` and deep link query params in templates.
